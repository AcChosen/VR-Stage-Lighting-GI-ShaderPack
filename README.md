# VR-Stage-Lighting-GI-ShaderPack
This repository contains the base main standard shader and projector shader that supports VRSLGI, including a separate cginc file named `VRSLGI-Functions.cginc` which contains code to create your own shaders that support the VRSL GI system. All files in this repository are open source under the MIT License. The VRSL GI Add-On package is not required, but this shader pack *is* required for the VRSL GI Add-On package.
