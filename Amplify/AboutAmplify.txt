The amplify functions are all in the VRSL_GI_Function_GetGI amplify function. That function has most of the pipeline split into nodes, mostly custom expression nodes. 
You can grab those custom expression nodes and copy and paste them into your shaders, or look at the "VRSL_GI_PureGI" example shader. That shader outputs nothing but the VRSL GI end pixel color.

The "Get GI" function has 6 inputs: Roughness, Metallic, World Position, World Normals Albedo Color, and Ambient Occlusion.

Roughness = Roughness
Metallic = Metallic
World Position = The world space position of the current pixel. This input already is grabbing the proper defaults, so there's no need to use it unless you are doing vertex transformations.
World Normals = The world space vertex normals. This input is already grabbing the proper defaults, so there's no need to use it unless you are doing vertex transformations.
Albedo Color = The Diffuse/Base/Albedo Color of the shader.
Ambient Occlusion = Ambient Occlusion. Default value is 1.
